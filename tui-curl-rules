Welcome To [95mBlackJack![0m
-> This Is a Terminal Based Black Jack Client. A Very Simple Way To Play!
-> Rules,
- your objective is to get the sum of your cards to 21,
  you can get closer to it on the lowerside, but as soon as you get over 21 you loose!
- after betting an amount, you are given 2 cards, and so is the dealer, but you can only see the dealers first card.
- you can choose to hit (/h) or stand (/s)
  hitting will allow you to choose another card to bring you closer to the sum of 21
  standing will allow you to stand on your position and wait for the dealers sum of cards.
  you want to stand when you are confident enough your sum is greater than the dealers
- if you win you will recieve the amount you you bet + the dealers matched amount (bet = 10, recieved = 20)
  you will also recieve exp, which will contribute to levels, upon higher levels, you will unlock perks like insurance and dub_exp
- if you loose, you will loose the amount you bet only and you will loose an exp point, THEY CAN GO NEGATIVE!
Have Fun!
